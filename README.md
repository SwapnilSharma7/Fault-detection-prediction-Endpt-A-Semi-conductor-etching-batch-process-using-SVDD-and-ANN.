# Fault-detection-prediction-Endpt-A-Semi-conductor-etching-batch-process-using-SVDD-and-ANN.
We received multiple datasets, each corresponding to a batch of the semiconductor etching process.
We utilized diverse clustering algorithms and one-class classification methods, such as SVDD, to identify and
eliminate faulty data from the normal batch data. Subsequently, an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model
was employed to predict Endpoint A, focusing on the faulty dataset after filtering out the normal data.
